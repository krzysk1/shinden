# shinden
The Kyushu J7W1 Shinden fighter was a World War II Japanese propeller-driven aircraft prototype that was built in a canard design. The wings were attached to the tail section and stabilizers were on the front. The propeller was also in the rear, in a pusher configuration. The Shinden was expected to be a highly maneuverable interceptor, but only two prototypes were finished before the end of war. A gas turbine–powered version was considered, but never even reached the drawing board. (wikipedia)
