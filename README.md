Kyushu J7W1 Shinden for Aerofly FS4

The Kyushu J7W1 Shinden fighter was a World War II Japanese propeller-driven aircraft prototype that was built in a canard design. The wings were attached to the tail section and stabilizers were on the front. The propeller was also in the rear, in a pusher configuration. The Shinden was expected to be a highly maneuverable interceptor, but only two prototypes were finished before the end of war. A gas turbine–powered version was considered, but never even reached the drawing board. (wikipedia)

This is free add-on for Aerofly FS4 created by Krzysztof Kaniewski with the Aerofly FS4 SDK.

- Shinden is a bomber interceptor, it is best at shooting down enemy bombers. It's turnrate is very marginal. (29.0s fully upgraded) It will find itself outperformed by other air superiority fighters of similar BR.

- Shinden's top speed of 740+ (762 kph fully upgraded) requires the height of 8.5km altitude to be flown. If you are low you are not fully utilizing one of the main strength of this aircraft (speed)

- The only thing that is capable of outrunning/catching you in a straight line at 8.5km are jets, rockets and dora D12/13s. As long as you fly straight and make minimal adjustments.

- Shinden's climb rate its mediocre at best (20.8m/s fully upgraded), you will need to climb to the side or to the back to avoid fast climbers.

- Shinden is quite responsive in a dive

- Shinden needs around 420~450 kph to execute a full vertical loop

- Shinden has a very high approach speed on landing (230+ kph) and requires a fairly long landing distance with its weak braking, so set up your approach early to prevent runway overrun


We know that take-off-speed should be inbetween 185-194 km/h as stated here http://i.imgur.com/xvksLP1.png (1st test - stick pulled at 185 and take off completed at 194 km/h)

And that stall speed should below or around that number.
